# Moodle Database Activity Templates

# Using Moodle Database Activity (MDBA) to have students track self-study
# behaviors is useful for teachers to keep students focused and on task for
# learning a language. These scripts are designed to help format the list view
# and the single view of the Moodle Database Activity. There are fields
# required to make use of these templates which are part of the core Database
# Activity fields available in Moodle. Each type of database activity will have
# an explanation of the fields that need to be defined. The latest templates
# are able to be copied into the template section of the Moodle Database
# Activity being used.

# Listening/Speaking Skills - Logging activities for these areas have not been
# decided yet.

# Reading Skills - Students learning EFL use Graded Readers to practice their
# English reading skills. The point of Extensive Reading (ER) is to read English
# books for enjoyment. The rules are "fast, fun, a lot, and no dictionary." In
# order to keep students on this important weekly task, use these MDBA
# activities.

# -- Weekly ER Time Logging <-- Students log the time they spend reading
# -- Book Quiz Make-Up   <-- Students write a short report if they fail a quiz
# -- Weekly Book Reports <-- Students use MDBA to write a book report

# Vocabulary Skills - Each student has a different level with vocabulary when
# it comes to learning English. They need to focus on the current list of words
# that are appropriate for them. This MDBA activity helps them track the time
# they spend studying vocabulary (VS).

# -- Weekly VS Time Logging <-- Students log the time they spend studying their
# own personal vocabulary.

# Writing Skills - Students practicing EFL writing for enjoyment, or sometimes
# called Extensive Writing (EW) work hard on composing blog posts several times
# per week. These MDBA activities help them stay on task and also help the
# teacher keep tabs on their writing output and their online discussion skills.

# -- Weekly EW Time Logging <-- Students log the time they spend writing in
# their own personal journal or on their blog. Also, commenting/discussion
# writing can also be tracked.
# -- Weekly Writing Highlight <-- Students write a report highlighting a
# journal entry or blog post of their own (or their classmates) which is
# especially meaningful for them. This output is used for in-class discussions.
