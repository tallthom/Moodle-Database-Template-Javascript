# Moodle Database Template Javascript

# Working on some template scripts to make database activities display
# in a more dynamic way. These scripts are specific for Moodle Database
# Template Javascript and require understanding of the type of Moodle
# Database activity for which they are designed.

# The Blog Logging scripts are useful for students making a database of
# blog post entries they made on their own blog. The template assumes they
# have a URL field and some other fields which will be published here later
