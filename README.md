# Moodle Database Activity Templates

# Using Moodle Database Activity to have students track self-study behaviors
# is useful for teachers to keep students focused and on task for learning
# a language. These scripts are designed to help format the list view and the
# single view of the Moodle Database Activity. There are fields required
# to make use of these templates which are part of the core Database Activity
# fields available in Moodle. Each type of database activity will have an
